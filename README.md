# video_data_generator
## Declaration
Most if not all the code included in this repository is learned from [anujshah](https://github.com/anujshah1003) either through watching his well prepared [youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/oy5EeamF_M8) or [github repository](https://github.com/anujshah1003/custom_data_generator.git). Do check out his code base as his implementation is more generic while mine is much customized to my project needs. Once again, I thank him for his wonderful work.

## My Work
On top of this work, I wrote [train_val_test_split](train_val_test_split.py) to help me separate video dataset into train, validation and test. This is very helpful when this dataset does not organized into these sub categories.
